It is written on extended version of Markdown (which is implemented by TSDoc subsystem) and uses SCons for building. The only supported backend for building book is HTML.

### Contents

This book describes basic principles and languages of dynamic tracing and operating system kernel internals and how they may be exposed with dynamic tracing. Last module of a book is devoted to tracing of userspace applications. 

There are 7 exercises in this book that allow you to try yourself in writing tracing scripts and observe mildly interesting aspects of computer systems. 

### Errors and requests
