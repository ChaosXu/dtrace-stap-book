### Exercize 4

#### Part 1

Implement scripts `pfstat.d` and `pfstat.stp` which will print count of pagefaults grouping by a mmapped file name (if it reachable). Print statistics once per second. Use proc\_starter experiment from [exercize 3][kernel/ex3] to demonstrate it and try to explain results you are getting (you may need to include additional outputs for that). 

#### Part 2

Implement scripts `kmemstatp.stp` and `kmemstat.d` which will gather stats on allocations and frees on per-cache basis for a _SLAB allocator_. Use an file\_opener experiment from [exercize 1][lang/ex1] to demonstrate your script and find a correlation between number of requests per-second generated by an experiment and cache allocations. What caches are primarily used while file is opened?
